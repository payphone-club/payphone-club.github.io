Identifying a payphone.

---

At the highest level, payphones are typically separated into two main classifications: 3-Slot and Single-Slot (or 1-Slot). 

3-Slot payphones are older and so-named because they have three coin slots on top: one for nickels, one for dimes, and one for quarters. Single-Slot payphones are newer-style phones and have a single coin slot on the front that accepts all coins.

Less common are Coinless payphones, payphones that require a payment but do not have a coin slot to accept coins. These payphones typically follow the Charge-A-Call model which utilizes calling cards or requires the user to request operator assistance for third-party billing. Alternatively, this classification of payphones can be used to refer to phones that only permit collect calls or calls paid with credit card (either by speaking to an operator or swiping the card at the phone itself). Coinless phones can often be conflated with armored or institutional phones as they serve similar purposes and can often be used interchangeably due to their robust, durable construction (ideal for public installations). While armored phones are typically used to in harsh environments for standard phone calls or a hotline system (such as for building entry), they may be configured as payphones and connect users to an operator to collect payment before a call can go through.
